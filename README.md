# Application Dump
Script will check for new lines on a Google Sheet and then if it finds a new line it will post that line to Discord.

To Do:
1) Fix so the first time it runs it will make the file it compares against instead of crashing since the file doesn't exist.
2) Allow for multiple submissions to happen and push those out instead of only the last update.
